                <h3>Last Updated on February14, 2019</h3>
                <p>Welcome to ComplianceRewards℠, a prescription discount program (the "<b>Service</b>"),
                    made available to you by Ingenious Mobility Ventures, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
                    company ("<b>IMV</b>", "<b>we</b>", "<b>us</b>", and "<b>our</b>"). This Privacy Policy describes our policies on 
                    the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you in connection with your use
                    of the Service, which may occur via our website <a href="www.imv.com" target="_blank">www.imv.com</a> ("<b>Website</b>") or the 
                    ComplianceRewards℠  mobile application ("<b>Application</b>").</p>
                <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is our policy to protect your personal information and
                    to use it only in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only governs 
                    our use and disclosure of information collected through this Website, Application or any 
                    component of the Service. When you use the Website, Application or any component of 
                    the Service, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of information about you 
                    as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to the collection, use and 
                    disclosure of your information as set forth above, you may not access or use the 
                    Website, Application or Service. Any capitalized term not defined in this Privacy Policy 
                    has the meaning given that term in the ComplianceRewards℠ <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/ConsumerPortal/termscondition" target="_blank">Terms of Service.</a></p> 

                <h3>Modifications to This Privacy Policy</h3>

                    current version of the Privacy Policy will be made available to you on the Website and

                    you on the Website or within the Application or both by posting a conspicuous notice on 
                    the Service prior to the effective date of the changes and you will be required to review 
                    and opt-in to the revised terms to continue to access the Service. By continuing to 
                    access or use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound 
                    by the revised Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the revised Privacy Policy, you may 
                    terminate your account as set forth in the Terms of Service.</p>

                    to activate this feature. You may choose to allow IMV to access your location by

                    this reference.</p> 

                <p><b>Technical data and related information:</b> In order to enhance your user experience

                <p><b>Personal Information:</b> In order to provide  our services we share personal Information 
                    with the Licensed Pharmacies in order to fulfill and deliver orders placed through the 
                    application. ComplianceRewards uses certain health information provided to it by the 
                    Licensed Pharmacies in compliance with applicable federal and state laws, including but 
                    not limited to the Health Information Privacy and Protection Act. The Licensed 
                    Pharmacies use Personal Information submitted by ComplianceRewards in accordance 
                    with the policies and procedures of each such Licensed Pharmacy, and such use of 
                    Personal Information by the Licensed Pharmacies may not be under the control of 
                    ComplianceRewards. ComplianceRewards hereby disclaims any and all liability for any 
                    type of damages including, but not limited to, indirect, incidental, consequential or 
                    special damages, or losses of expenses, for the actions and customer information 
                    practices of any of the Licensed Pharmacies.</p>  
                <p>We do not sell, rent, loan, or lease any Personal Information. We may disclose Personal 
                    Information to the government or private parties in connection with a lawsuit, subpoena, 
                    investigation, regulatory examination or similar proceedings. We may also disclose 
                    Personal Information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take 
                    action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats 
                    to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Terms, to verify or enforce 
                    compliance with the policies governing the ComplianceRewards application and 
                    applicable laws, or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal 
                    requirements. Additionally, in the event we go through a business transition such as a 
                    merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, or a 
                    transfer of any type of our assets to another company, Personal Information may be 
                    among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are 
                    permitted by the Terms.</p>      
                <p>Personal Information may be stored locally on your mobile device and may be 
                    transmitted across our servers in the United States. The transmission of information 
                    over wireless and wired networks is not inherently secure. We encrypt data transmitted 
                    through the ComplianceRewards application using SSL technology to help protect the 
                    Personal Information. The only ComplianceRewards representatives, agents or 
                    employees allowed to access Personal Information are those who are authorized by
                    ComplianceRewards to do so and/or access such Personal Information in order to 
                    ensure that the orders placed through the ComplianceRewards application are 
                    transmitted to a Licensed Pharmacy, and filled and delivered to you in a timely and 
                    efficient manner.</p>   

                <p><b>Referral Program:</b> If you refer a friend to use the ComplianceRewards application through the invite feature 
                    in the ComplianceRewards application, we will automatically send your friend a one-
                    time message inviting him or her to use the Code included in such email to obtain
                    Referral Credit. We may store the email address and name of your friend for the sole 
                    purpose of sending this one-time message and tracking the success of our referral 
                    program, and do not use this information for any other marketing purpose unless we 
                    obtain consent from that person or we explicitly state otherwise. Please be aware that 
                    when you use any invite functionality through the ComplianceRewards application, your 
                    email address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>

                <p><b>Cookies:</b> Cookies are small data files that consist of unique identifiers and reside on 
                    your computer, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages. Cookies may transmit 
                    information about you and your use of the Service, such as your browser type, search 
                    preferences and the date and time of your use. Cookies may be persistent or stored 
                    only during an individual session and may serve the following purposes:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li> To prevent fraud, protect your data from unauthorized parties, and comply with 
                        legal requirements. For example, we use cookies to determine if you are logged 
                        in to the Service or not.</li>
                    <li> To remember information about how you prefer the Service to behave and look. 
                        For example, we use cookies that tell us whether or not you have declined to 
                        allow us to use location information.</li>
                    <li> To make the Service work in the way you expect it to. For example, we may use 
                        a cookie to tell us whether you have already signed up for the Service.</li>
                    <li> To help us understand how visitors use the Service. For example, we employ 
                        analytics that use cookies to identify which type of device and operating system 
                        version you are using to access the Service and how that may affect your user 
                        experience.</li>
                    <li> To allow notice of information or options that we think could improve your use of 
                        the Service. For example, we may use a cookie to allow us to stop showing you 
                        the sign-up screen if you have already signed in.</li>
                    <li> To gain information about your online activities in order to provide you online ads 
                        and other marketing materials as set forth below.</li>
                </ul>   
                <p><b>Managing Cookies:</b> It may be possible to disable some (but not all) cookies through 
                    your device or browser settings, but doing so may affect your ability to use the Service 
                    and your preference settings may not be saved. The method for disabling cookies may 
                    vary by device and browser, but can usually be found in preferences or security 
                    settings.</p> 
                <p><b>Ad Networks:</b> We use third party ad networks (called third-party ad servers or network 
                    advertisers, including Google, Tapjoy, UpRival  and Conversant) to deliver ads to you 
                    on our behalf. These third party ad networks may place their cookies, web beacons or 
                    other technology on the Website or the Application or in your browser to collect non-
                    personally identifiable information about you when you visit this Website or use this 
                    Application (such as browser type, time and date, browsing or transaction activity, 
                    subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, or a platform-provided identifier 
                    during your visits to this and other websites) to enable those third party ad networks to 
                    deliver to you advertisements on third party websites and mobile applications for our 
                    products or services or those of third parties that are likely to be of greater interest to 
                    you. For example, Google uses the Doubleclick cookie to enable it and its partners to 
                    serve ads to you based on your visit to our Website and/or other sites on the Internet.</p> 
                <p>We encourage you to view the privacy policy of advertisers and ad services to learn 
                    more about their cookies and other technologies. To learn more about interest-based

                    Reporting. The Google Display Network Impression Reporting uses the Google 
                    Analytics cookie to track our ad impressions and your interactions with those 
                    impressions, including the effectiveness of those ads, which generates reports for us to 
                    help us analyze our advertisements. Remarketing with Google Analytics uses the 
                    Google Analytics cookie to serve advertisements to you across the Internet based on 
                    your visit to our Web Site. Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting uses 
                    a third party cookie to collect information about our website traffic by tracking users 
                    across websites and across time, which generates a report for us to better understand 
                    our website users.</p>  
                <p>We also use the Google AdWords service to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet 
                    and sometimes on this Website. Google uses cookies (or other similar identifiers) to 
                    collect anonymous information about your visits to our Website and your interaction with
                    our products and services to generate targeted advertisements to you on other sites 
                    that you visit across the Internet.</p> 
                <p>If you do not want Google to collect and use this information you may visit the Google 
                    Ad Settings page <a href="#" target="_blank">(www.google.com/safetycenter/tools/#manage-your-ads-preferences)</a> 
                    or you can also visit the <a href="websitewww.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="_blank">websitewww.networkadvertising.org/choices</a> as referenced 
                    above to change your consumer preferences with respect to certain online ads and to 
                    obtain further information about third party ad networks and online behavioral 
                    advertising. For the Google Analytics Advertising Features, you may also opt-out of our 
                    use of Google Analytics as described above. Please remember that changing your 
                    settings with certain browsers and ad networks will not carry your privacy choices 
                    across browsers and other ad networks.</p>
